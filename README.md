This project takes part in Nantes Metropole and has been made with the given data. It has for objective to reduce the food waste in canteens in kindergarten 
and elementary school. 
For this project, I try reducing the food waste for the 2018-2019 school year taking all the previous years to train the model. 

In the main.py file, you will find only the least to make the model work for the 2018-2019 school year. 
If you wanna know more about the choices I made for the features or the model I took, I let you navigate between all the different python files.
